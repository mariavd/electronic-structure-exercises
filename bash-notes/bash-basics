# User specific aliases and functions

# These are typically part of the .bashrc

# bash history, i.e. pressing the up arrow in the terminal shows the previously used commands
# don't put duplicate lines or lines starting with space in the history. 
# See bash(1) for more options   
HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth

# append to the history file, don't overwrite it       
shopt -s histappend      

# for setting history length see HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE in bash(1) 
HISTSIZE=2000 
HISTFILESIZE=3000                                      




# Some commonly used aliases. They could instead go to ~/.bash_aliases (in practice the effect is the same)

alias ll='ls -ltrh' # all information about the files ordered by modification time
alias lx='ls -X' # sort by extension
alias lsf='ls -p | grep -v / '  # list files but not directories

# going several levels up 
alias ..='cd ..'
alias ...='cd ../..'
alias .3='cd ../../..'
alias .4='cd ../../../../'
alias .5='cd ../../../../../'



# On clusters the work directory is often not your home directory.
# Usually admins have defined a $WRKDIR for every user
# It is handy to go to it easily since you will be doing your calculations there
alias cdw='cd $WRKDIR' 



# My own preferences 
alias bsh='vim ~/.bashrc'
alias sbsh='source ~/.bashrc'

alias history='history | less'

# A bash function can take arguments. Here we can give it the name of a
# compressed .tar.gz archive and it will extract the files to a subdirectory

function untar() {
    name="$@" &&
    dirname=${name/.*/} &&
    mkdir $dirname &&
    tar xzvf $name --directory $dirname;
